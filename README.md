# gdoc2chromium
Parses gdoc files created by Google Drive Sync client (windows version) and opens the url with chromium-browser.

Do not run sh install.sh with sudo (it needs to reach home of user).

Dependency for compiling: pyinstaller.

To compile and install from source code, use install_compile.sh.

To install pre-compiled binary, use install_binary.sh.

THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT MAINTANED AS I STARTED USING INSYNC, WHICH ALREADY HAS THIS FEATURE.
